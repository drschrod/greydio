**Decentralized Streaming Platform - Technical Specifications**

## **Project Overview**
The Decentralized Streaming Platform is a blockchain-based peer-to-peer music streaming service that incentivizes users to upload, host, and stream music. The architecture follows a **Napster-like** decentralized model where users act as nodes to distribute and stream music.

## **Blockchain & Token Model**

### **1. Blockchain Architecture**
- **Custom In-House Blockchain**: A fully decentralized blockchain will be developed to store metadata and transaction records.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: A Proof-of-Activity (PoA) mechanism will be used, rewarding users for hosting and streaming activity.
- **Transaction Compression**: Sparse Merkle Trees will be implemented to optimize block storage.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) will be used to store and retrieve music files efficiently.
- **Redundancy Strategy**: File redundancy will be managed to prevent single points of failure in decentralized storage.

### **2. Token Economy**
Two types of tokens will govern the platform:

#### **A. Ownership Token**
- **Purpose**: Represents song ownership and enforces royalty payments.
- **Earning Mechanism**:
  - Granted to the original uploader of a song.
  - Owners receive **streaming royalties** from listeners.
  - Tokens can be transferred or sold to other users.

#### **B. Popularity Token**
- **Purpose**: Rewards hosts for streaming and distributing songs.
- **Earning Mechanism**:
  - Users earn popularity tokens by hosting and serving streams.
  - The more popular a song becomes, the **lower the token reward per stream**, encouraging hosting of a variety of songs.
  - Popularity tokens will have a **burn mechanism** to allow songs to regain popularity over time.

## **Smart Contract System**

### **1. Upload Verification System**
- **Reputation-Based Uploading**: Users need a minimum reputation score or must stake tokens to upload.
- **Audio Fingerprinting**: Prevents duplicate uploads of existing songs.
- **Manual Verification by Streamers**: Verified streamers can approve songs for the network.
- **Token Slashing for Spam Uploads**: Users who upload spam content lose staked tokens.

### **2. Streaming Verification System**
- **Prevents Self-Streaming**: Users cannot stream their own uploaded songs to game the reward system.
- **Tracks Unique Listeners**: Listeners are rewarded for playing a song only once per time interval.
- **Smart Contract Events**: Streaming transactions emit events to track distribution and engagement.

## **Decentralized Storage Mechanism**

### **1. Storage & Retrieval**
- **Metadata Storage**: Stored on the blockchain, including title, artist, year, and genre.
- **Audio File Storage**: Distributed across a DHT network, ensuring decentralization.
- **Redundancy Management**: Multiple nodes host each file to ensure availability.

### **2. Retrieval Optimization**
- **Sparse Merkle Trees**: Used for efficient transaction lookup.
- **DHT Lookup Strategy**: Ensures fast retrieval of audio files.

## **Security Measures**
- **Smart Contract Security Enhancements**: Prevents exploits like spam uploads and self-streaming.
- **Transaction Simulation Testing**: Ensures all economic mechanisms work as intended before deployment.
- **Automated Unit Testing**: Guarantees reliability of smart contracts.

## **Frontend & User Interaction**

### **1. Web3 Integration**
- **Frontend Built with React & Vite**
- **TypeScript for Strong Typing**
- **ethers.js for Blockchain Interactions**

### **2. Features**
- **Stream & Upload Music**
- **Earn Tokens for Hosting & Listening**
- **Monitor Earnings & Transaction History**

## **Deployment & Next Steps**

### **1. Local Development**
- **Hardhat for Local Blockchain Testing**
- **Unit Tests for Smart Contracts**

### **2. Testnet Deployment**
- Deploy contracts to **Sepolia or Goerli** for public testing.
- Conduct stress tests to measure system performance.

### **3. Mainnet Deployment**
- Finalize security audits.
- Launch on a **scalable Layer 2 blockchain** (Optimism, Arbitrum, or a custom chain).

This document outlines the foundational elements of the Decentralized Streaming Platform. The next steps involve testing smart contracts, finalizing security mechanisms, and preparing for deployment on a testnet. Further optimizations will focus on improving storage retrieval efficiency and refining the economic model.
